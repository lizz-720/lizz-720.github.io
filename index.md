* Lab 6, Part 2

    Although this lab was challenging, I remember this lab vividly. It was fun learning how to play blackjack and creating a game where we were able to use a command name and it computes the score of the given cards. It was challenging because, either the number of arguments was wrong, or the card was invalid, but we pulled through and made it fun enough to learn about in our lab.

* Lab 7, Part 2

    This lab was one of my favorite labs because we had to write a code that allows cars to park at all times and restrict other streets from parking. We had to implement rules on signs and create a system that can computerize whether or not a car can park in that street. The most challenging part about it was to create a loop that can constantly repeat the code for certain parking rules. Overall, it was a fun and entertaining lab.

* Lab 9, Part 2

    This lab was fun because we used two strings to represent the eating and sleeping schedule of two philosophers. Once the strings were set, it was challenging trying to figure out not to interfere with the schedules of both philosophers. Overall, it was a fun lab to learn and code about.
